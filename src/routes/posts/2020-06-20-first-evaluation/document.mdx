# About the project
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The OpenStreetMap (OSM) project has established formal  Organised Editing Guidelines,
which require all groups and organized activities of mapping on OpenStreetMap to report 
transparently how they organize and what they are mapping on.<br></br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The Tasking Manager is the most used application in the OSM ecosystem 
for volunteers, but also professionals, to 
team up and coordinate mapping. In order to ease up the user experience of fulfilling 
the guidelines for organized editing, the goal of my project this summer is to make the 
process of reporting back data for OpenStreetMap automatically.

# Project solutions
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In the first step, we started with an analysis of contents and fields 
that are required or suggested by the organized editing guidelines, then we check whether 
these are already available in the Tasking Manager, or not.<br></br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Then we implemented a small proof of concept for testing out how 
the communication between Tasking Manager and OpenStreetMap should occur. Although the OSM’s organized editing 
guidelines suggest the project wiki for reporting of organized mapping activities, we wanted to include 
two technical ideas for this initial test:
<ul>
   <li>Report data directly to the OpenStreetMap wiki</li>
   <li>Store files in a human-readable format in a git repository (GitHub, Gitlab, etc)</li>
</ul> 
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;We would like to have a broader conversation about the 
benefits of each approach and we are planning 
to reach out to OSM’s Data Working Group to ask for their feedback.

## Wiki solution

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To report data directly to the OpenStreetMap wiki, we adapted the solution 
currently used by OpenStreetMap to the requirements of the Tasking Manager, 
which was basically to adjust the existing pages on the OpenStreetMap wiki to a new format. 
This was done using a python library called wikitextparser, which converts a string to 
wikitext (the file format used on the OpenStreetMap wiki).<br></br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;For creating and editing the pages of a MediaWiki instance 
(OpenStreetMap, Wikipedia, and others are examples of MediaWiki instances) we 
used the MediaWiki API. Below is a very simple example of adding a table 
in a wiki page via the Mediawiki API.

```python
import requests

# Data of table to be added in the wiki page
table_data = (
   "{|class='wikitable sortable'\n"
   "|-\n"
   '! scope="col" | Name\n'
   '! scope="col" | Link\n'
   "|-\n"
   "| Covid 19\n"
   "| [[COVID19]]\n"
   "|-\n"
   "|}\n"
)
 
# params of request to create wiki page
params = {
   "action": "edit",
   "title": "covid 19",
   "createonly": "true",
   "contentmodel": "wikitext",
   "bot": "true",
   "format": "json"
}
 
# request to create wiki page
session = requests.Session()
session.post(
   url=WIKI_API_ENDPOINT,
   params=params,
   data={
       "token": WIKI_API_TOKEN,
       "text": table_data
   }
)
```

## Git solution

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To store files in a human-readable format, the python library 
YAML was used, which converts YAML to other native python formats and vice versa. 
To save and edit the YAML files in a git repository, the GitHub API was used. Below 
is a code example that parses a python dictionary to a YAML file and saves it in a GitHub repository.
```python
import yaml
import base64
import requests
import json
 
# Data of the yaml file to be saved in the repo
data = {
   "project": {
       "title": "Covid 19",
   }
}
 
# parse json to yaml encoded in base64
yaml_file = yaml.dump(data, allow_unicode=True)
encoded_yaml_file = base64.b64encode(bytes(yaml_file, 'utf-8'))
 
# request data in the format required by github API
request_data = {
   "committer": {
       "name": GITHUB_COMMITER_NAME,
       "email": GITHUB_COMMITER_EMAIL
   },
   "message": "Add project title",
   "content": encoded_yaml_file.decode("utf-8")
}
 
# create yaml file in the root of repo
requests.put(
   "https://api.github.com/"
   f"repos/{GITHUB_REPOSITORY}/contents/covid19_project.yaml",
   headers={
       "Content-Type": "application/json",
       "Authorization": "Bearer " + GITHUB_API_TOKEN
   },
   data=json.dumps(request_data)
)

```

# Missing fields

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Also, it was necessary to add the required or suggested 
fields by the organized editing guidelines that were not included in the Tasking Manager. 
Some of these fields are just waiting for the Pull Request approval for being added to 
the Tasking Manager codebase, and the other ones that aren’t included in Pull Requests 
are just waiting for the OSM’s Data Working Group feedback, if their inclusion is really necessary.

# Conclusion

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The first month of GsoC has been an extraordinary experience. 
I am acquiring a lot of knowledge in this short period of time. In addition, 
I also see it as an excellent opportunity to apply all the content seen in the 
subjects of the college. Stay tuned for the second evaluation post. See y’all!
